        <p>
          On a small planet, as we flew by, artifacts were discovered that were
          considered by the local civilization to be part of the "Culture".

        <p>
          In an attempt to clarify this concept, and as a result of completing a

            The principles cherished by the creators and consumers of the
            "Culture" were manifested in various forms across different tangible
            mediums.
