          The principles cherished by the creators and consumers of the
          "Culture" were manifested in various forms across different tangible
          mediums.

        <p>Here are some examples where we were able to make out something.</p>

          We discover cultural artifacts that belong to different temporal
          segments of the local civilization's existence.

        <p>
          At least, often, by analyzing the depth of their burial, the half-life
          period of radioactive elements, or just of how it looks, it is
          possible to determine when the artifacts were created.

          We encounter cultural artifacts scattered across various regions of
          the planet, excluding those covered by liquid surfaces. (Indeed, it is
          still unclear what displeased them about the liquid, although we did
          find something there too.)

              Books are when conceptual structures are first expressed in a
              sequence of commonly accepted symbols (words), then the sound
              analogues of these words are broken down into a sequence of
              sounds, and then the sounds are represented by graphical symbols.
              Afterwards, chains of symbols are sequentially recorded.

              The population found pleasure in the elusive patterns of sound
              sequences. Apparently, such sounds were intentionally recorded and
              then repeatedly played.
